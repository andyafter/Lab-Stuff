\section{Motion Segmentation}
We were able to achieve data transmission from the robot with very less latency. We also demonstrated the use of gestures in the virtual reality platform to alter the robot's navigation parameters. A sample video showing this can be found at <give vimeo link here>. Using Mozilla as the platform for visualization of data allows implementation of MozVR based APIs in the system. The VR system was able to understand gestures (left swipe, right swipe, and pinch) using the installed infra-red optical trackers.
