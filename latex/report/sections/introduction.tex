{\bf Fast Motion Segmentation with Neuromorphic Sensors Utilizing Biological Principles}
A biologically inspired algorithm utilizing saccade like micro-motions
to capture data from a neuromorphic imager was developed. The
algorithm concerns the development of novel asynchronous signal
processing algorithms to process information resulting from the
micro-motions.

{\bf Vibro-Tactile Haptic Glove}
We aim at designing a lightweight, wireless vibro-tactile glove to facilitate human perception of remote robotic environments. The vibratory actuators are placed at sensitive locations of the palm to deliver precise and localized haptic feedback. The objective is to make these gloves robust to userâ€™s hand poses.


 {\bf Virtual Reality Visualization}
 The project enables a VR environment (CAVE or virtual headset) to
 communicate, transfer and render data wirelessly at a low latency
 between robots and haptic gloves. In case of haptic gloves, the
 objective is to allow rendition of virtual objects in form of
 vibratory stimuli. In case of robots, the objective is to transfer
 visual scene information in near real-time from remotely located
 robots to a VR environment. In addition, a tele-operator can control
 the robots to perform appropriate actions as tracking and following
 other objects and object recognition.
