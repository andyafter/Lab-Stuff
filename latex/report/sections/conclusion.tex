\section{Motion Segmentation }
Future work will involve the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Development of an API for processing a gesture language. Gestures will be used to direct the robot to identify objects of particular category and follow them using the motion segmentation algorithm with a neuromorphic vision sensor.
	
	\item Develop a method to render point-cloud information from the scene in the VR room. This will be possible by transferring data encoded in $XDM$ format.
	
	\item An algorithm to enable tracking-following will be developed by utilizing the previous work on motion segmentation. This algorithm will develop a computation layer on top of the motion segmentation algorithm to localize on specific objects in the environment. A study will be performed to compare and quantify the results obtained, and the paper submitted to Frontiers in Neuromorphic Engineering. 
\end{itemize}
