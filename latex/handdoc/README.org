* iLimb Controlling
The iLimb controlling is composed by several different part:
- Core code uploading
- Keyboard controlling
- Programming manipulation

For more advanced features, read the source code of /Core/.
** Keyboard Controlling 
iLimb Core contains the core project for iLimb development board provided together with iLimb robot hand. Please refer to the iLimb devboard manual for details of development environment setup.
