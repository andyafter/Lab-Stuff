* Virtual Reality Controlling with UR10
** UR10 Robot Specification
The implementation of any version of inverse kinematics requires the knowledge of 
the size and machanical specifications of the robotic arm. Here the real robot 
size are presented below. You can either choose to **translate** it into 3d space, 
or simply use real world scale measures to carry the implementation.
