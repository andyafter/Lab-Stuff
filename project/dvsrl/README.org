#+TITLE: Reinforcement Learning Exploration with DVS

* Introduction
This project contains Python scripts for visual servoing with DVS. 

* Requirements and Running
You should have Python installed and jAER downloaded and configured. 

Connect the eDVS 128 camera to to the USB port of a PC. Open jAER and choose the USB port of the camera. Set the baud rate to 12MB/S. Last but not least you should turn on the remote UDP connection in jAER.

** Introduction to Scripts
1. ~loadaerdat.py~ reads DVS data file and provide formulated dataset
2. ~raw_udp.py~ reads data from DVS camera and provide actions in real time
3. ~urcontrol.py~ provides code for the camera to interact with UR10 in real time
